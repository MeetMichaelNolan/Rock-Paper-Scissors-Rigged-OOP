# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Rigged-OOP
I made this game for my mom the morning of 11/4/21 as a joke. It is rock, paper, scissors but rigged.
It is rock, paper, scissors but no matter what you put in, the computers answer will be the winner.
I thought it would be funny to have my mom play rock, paper, scissors then switch to this game and have her lose every single game.
